# Web_Calc
A (very) simple JavaScript-based web application which I created for my web engineering elective course.

This project demonstrates basic calculator functionality and form validation in the guise of a time-tracking application.  I used a rudimentary state machine as the foundation for the calculator behavior.

Error states that exist when saving calculated time, or submitting the form itself, are displayed dynamically using JavaScript and embedded CSS.  The error-states are constructive and direct so I will not enumerate them here.
